The plan that we wrote in class connects with my code as in our plan we said that the player object would have a script attaached to it for movement, AKA the Player script which would also have a serialized field for the rigidbody2D and the speed. We also said we would use prefabs for the seeds so that they can be easily duplicated and the player script will allow the seed prefab to be instatiated when the spacebar is pressed, this is also a serialized field that would be assigned in the inspector. Additionally we said there would be a UI object called the PlantCountUI which would have a script attached to it that would update the text when seeds were planted by increasing the number of seeds planted and decreasing the number of seeds remaining and updating the text objects with those values.
